### Prerequisites

1. PHP: You'll need PHP version 10. or higher installed on your machine. You can check your PHP version by running php -v in the command line.

2. Composer: Composer is a PHP package manager that is required for Laravel. You can download and install it from the official website: https://getcomposer.org/download/

3. MySQL: Ensure you have a MySQL database server set up or any other database supported by Laravel.

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Nate-go/school-verse.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd school-verse
   ```
3. Install project dependencies:
   ```sh
   composer install
   ```
4. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
5. Generate the application key:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
6. Configure the database:
    * Open the `.env` file in a text editor.
    * Set the database connection details like `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` according to your MySQL setup.
7. Run the database migrations:
   ```sh
   php artisan migrate
   ```
8. Serve the application:
   ```sh
   php artisan serve
   ```
9. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to see the application running.
   
Congratulations! You have successfully cloned, installed, and run the Laravel project on your local machine. Now you can start exploring and customizing it for your needs.
